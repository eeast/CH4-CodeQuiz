# Challenge 4 - Code Quiz

## Description

This website was built from scratch to pratice and demonstrate understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. We were tasked with creating an interactive quiz game that would present the user with a series of coding related questions over a set period of time, with a timer indicating the time remaining. Wrong questions should reduce the amount of remaining time, and correct answers should increase the score. When time is finished, the user should be presented with the final score, and be give the opportunity to add their score and initials to the leaderboard of top scores in the past. Top scores should persist through reloads.
